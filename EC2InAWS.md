# what is EC2

-  EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to run virtual servers, known as **instances**,
in the cloud. These instances can be used to run applications, host websites,
process data, and much more. EC2 gives you the flexibility to choose the computing power (CPU), memory, storage, and networking capacity based on your needs.
